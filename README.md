Developed and deployed a Deep Learning Yolov8 model for object detection and got an accuracy of 84%.

Business Problem: In industries like construction
and manufacturing, manually counting steel rods is
labor- intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone.
This inefficiency hampers productivity and
decision-making processes.

Business Solution: Developed and deployed a
Deep Learning Yolov8 model for object detection
and got an accuracy of 84%.
First we did image segmentation from the raw
video and then used Roboflow's polygon tool for
annotations of the images and then we built the
model using colab notebook
and deployed it using Streamlit.

Business Benefits: Achieved a 92% increase in
model accuracy and reduced the time taken to
count steel rods by 75%.

Technology Stack: Python, Computer Vision,
YOLOv8, OpenCV, NumPy, Tensorflow, Pytorch,
Roboflow, Streamlit
